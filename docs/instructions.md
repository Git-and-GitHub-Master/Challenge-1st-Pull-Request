# Instructions

After working through the [Hello, World!](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) guide try your hand at the process by making a fork of the class repository list and adding a link to your repository. The create a pull request so that your changes can be incorporated into the list.

1. Make a fork the class repository list, [SKHS-GDP-2019-2020/Class-Repositories](https://github.com/SKHS-GDP-2019-2020/Class-Repositories).
1. Create a branch for your changes, the name of the branch _could_ be anything, but a name that explains the purpose of the branch is great. For example, I might name a branch ```adding_doug_urner```.

   It is _highly_ likely that others in the class will be editing ```index.md``` at the same time and that I will be mergining their changes &mdash; so your fork may get behind the "official" copy. Being on a branch will make it much easier to pich up any changes that happend after you forked the repository.
1. Read the description of how the **index.md** file works in **README.md** (which is the file that is displayed when you go to the repository).
1. Then click on **index.md** in the file list and experiment with how it works:
   - Expand and collapse the sections for each block.
   - See where the links take you. If you're one of the first to tackle this challenge, you'll only see links to my GitHub profile.
1. Then click on the edit pencil to look at the code that makes the page work.
1. Examine the code -- notice the patterns:
   - The sections for each block.
   - The lines for each repository link.
1. Follow that pattern to add a line that links to your GitHub profile. It should:
   - Be in alphabetical order by your last name (but for privacy, use only your last initial).
   - Link to your GitHub profile.
1. Commit your changes.
1. Test that they work. You should see:
   - The sections for the class block should expand and close when you click on them.
   - Your link should be visible and look like the others.
   - When you click on your link it should take you to your GitHub profile.
1. When everything works, create a pull request.

<!-- Don't edit links here, change them in _data/assignment.yml instead, -->
