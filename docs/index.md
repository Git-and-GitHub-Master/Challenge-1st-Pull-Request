# Overview

<img class="overview-image" src="assets/images/screen-capture.png">

Here's a challenge! After verifying your GitHub account and learning a bit about working with GitHub through the [Hello, World!][hw] activity, try out your new skills on a small project of your own:
* fork the class repository list,
* add a link to your GitHub profile to the list, and 
* create a pull request to add your changes to the list.

Don't dawdle, this is a limited time offer -- once we start using GitHub on a regular basis, I will add any missing links myself and close this assignment. Be sure to check the close date.

<!-- Don't edit links here, change them in _data/assignment.yml instead, -->
