# Overview

Here's a challenge! After creating your GitHub account and learning about how to work with GitHub from the [Hello, World!][hw] activity, try out your new skills on a small project of your own: add a link to your GitHub profile to our class repository list.

Don't dawdle, this is a limited time offer -- once we start using GitHub on a regular basis, I will add any missing links myself and close this assignment. Be sure to check the close date.

<!-- Don't edit links here, change them in _data/assignment.yml instead, -->
